# Alarm_app

This is a Python code that creates a simple alarm clock with a graphical interface using the Tkinter library. It allows users to set the time for the alarm and play a sound when the alarm goes off. The code also uses the threading and datetime libraries for managing the alarm and getting the current time, respectively.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run this code, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer. You also need to install the following libraries:

- Tkinter
- threading
- datetime
- winsound (for playing sound on Windows)

You can install these libraries using the pip package manager by running the following command in your terminal:

```Terminal
pip install tkinter threading datetime winsound
```

### Running the Code
To run the code, simply open your terminal, navigate to the directory where the code is located, and run the following command:

```Terminal
python alarm_clock.py
```
This will launch the GUI window of the alarm clock.

## How to Use

1. Set the time for the alarm by selecting the hour, minute, and second from the respective dropdown menus.
2. Click on the "Set Alarm" button to start the alarm.
3. When the current time matches the set alarm time, a message will be printed on the console and a sound will be played.
